# ProjectDaft
A quick program in Python that uses daftlistings (https://github.com/AnthonyBloomer/daftlistings) to email rental listings (since I could not continuously monitor the app) that meet a specific criteria to help me navigate Ireland's housing crisis.

The program takes an xml input file with the email(s) of users that you wish to email the search results to, along with specific search parameters for that user.
